Some Coding practices:

1. Follow PEP8 coding conventions
2. Use sensible names for variables
3. Dont hard code instead declare variables and use them
4. Code reusability - Use functions for reusable code
5. Assert whenever possible
6. Comment where and all needed and document using jupyter notebook
7. Please remove unnecessary code or comments(written for our verification) before uploading on Github.

Grading:

Your projects are graded according to the following weights: (25%) Quality of finished written proposal (25%) Quality of Python code in your project (50%) Verbal presentation.

With respect to your Python code, I'm looking for good code practices like we have been discussing in class (documentation, asserts, etc.). Your code should be complete meaning that I should be able to pull and run your code. You can use a conda environment with requirements.txt or environment.yaml if necessary.

As in industry, verbal presentation is paramount! You have exactly 10 minutes. Pick one or two team members as the primary presenter(s) and practice with your team until you can reliably hit the main points that you promised in your proposal (e.g., Why? What? How? Who?). Concentrate on simplifying your core message. Don't create a cluttered verbal presentation. Quality, not quantity, is what counts.
